This application was developed and tested on Chrome.

Usage :
Tables with open checks are marked RED and are occupied. All other tables are available and marked GREEN.

Click a table to open an options dialog. The table's check status is visible the upper left. Open a check via the "Open Check" button. You can now add menu items via the menu item drop down to the check.
Once an item is added to a check, it can be voided within the table itself. Click the void button to void a given menu item.
Once the check is ready to close, click the "Close Check" button. It will shortly appear in the lower closed check table. The details can be re-visited via the show/hide details button.

Restaurant wide open checks are visible only within the table themselves. If a table has an open check, it is red and the details can be viewed within the table dialog.
Restaurant wide closed checks are organized by table via the table selection. Each closed check can be viewed within the table dialog, sorted by most recent.
In addition, restaurant wide closed checks are aggregated in the lower portion of the main page. These are also sorted by most recent.
